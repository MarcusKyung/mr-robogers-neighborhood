## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does as well as any other information you want users or other developers to have.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download codebase from GH to your desktop/local machine ensuring all files/directories have been included._
* _Navigate to top level of project directory._
* _Open index.html file using a browser._
* _Enter a number in the provided input area._
* _Receive text output based on number input._

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
